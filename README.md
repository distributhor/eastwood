# Utility Functions

The good, the bad and the ugly. A few basic JS utilities for which there are probably better alternatives.

A few utility functions that are similar to some other ones out there. These just very specifically do what I want need - no more, no less - without additional bloat. Therefore, they are not necessarily feature complete for everyone's
use cases. If you are still interested to take a look: https://distributhor.github.io/eastwood/
