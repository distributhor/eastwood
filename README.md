# Utility Functions

Thou shalt not util, but this is the wild west. Do you feel lucky, Punk?

A few utility functions that are similar to some other (better) ones out there. These just very specifically do what I want (emphasis on I) - no more, no less - without additional bloat. Therefore, they are not necessarily feature complete for your use cases, but are sufficient for mine. If you are still interested to take a look: https://distributhor.github.io/eastwood/
