# Wild West

Thou shalt not util. But this is the wild west.

These are some personal utility functions. It's highly debatable whether most of them are necessary at all. And in the cases where one can argue so, there are usually better and more established ways to accomplish some of these things (perhaps consider lodash instead). However, _because of reasons_ I ended up with a few functions of my own.

They work for me in some limited use cases, but may not work for everyone in all use cases. Trying to be comprehensive is certainly not an outright aim. Use it, (probably) don't use it. To see what there is: https://distributhor.github.io/wild-west/

Forever a work in progress
